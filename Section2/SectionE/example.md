# Complete and debug a function that accepts parameters and returns a value.

## Reusable code;
- writing code in the form of functions enables you to reuse the code for different purposes.

## local vs global scope,
- global:
 - accessible from anywhere
 - outside all code blocks
 - if statements, looops, functions and curly braces create code blocks
- local:
 - inside code blocks {}
 - only accessible where it is declared

## redefining variables,
- possible with let and var but not with const

## passing parameters,

## value vs. reference,
- primitive datatypes are passed by value, they can't be changed inside a function when passed into the function
- non-primitive datatypes are passed by reference, they can be change from within a function when passed into the function

## return values
- return causes the control to jump out of the function and return to the calling code scope (could be global or another function)
